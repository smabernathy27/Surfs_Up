# Surfs_Up
Module 9 Challenge
## Overview
The purpose of the analysis was to examine the weather for the proposed new surf shop in Hawaii by looking at temps and percipation throughout the past couple of years.

##Results
- The average difference in temperature from June to December is aroun 5 degrees. So the shop can most likely be open year round.
- The minimum temp in December was 56 degrees. Not exactly warm but still viable for surfing.
- The max temp was in June at 85 degrees which is certainly not too hot to be outside.

## Summary
It looks like the temps are viable all year round for Hawaii. A couple other things I'd like to know is the precipation stats for the months of June and Decemeber so we can analyze. The other query I'd run is adding in two additional months of March and September so we can more complete year round picutre.
